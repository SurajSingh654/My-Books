    <h2>The Definitive Java Programming Guide</h2>
    <p>Fully updated for Java SE 11, Java: The Complete Reference, Eleventh Edition explains how to develop, compile, debug, and run Java programs. Best-selling programming author Herb Schildt covers the entire Java language, including its syntax,
      keywords, and fundamental programming principles. You’ll also find information on key portions of the Java API library, such as I/O, the Collections Framework, the stream library, and the concurrency utilities. Swing, JavaBeans, and servlets
      are examined and numerous examples demonstrate Java in action. Of course, the very important module system is discussed in detail.
    </p>
    <p>This Oracle Press resource also offers an introduction to JShell, Java’s interactive programming tool. Best of

    <h2>Introduction To Algorithms</h2>
    <p>The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in
      English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor. The third edition has been revised and
      updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called “Divide-and-Conquer”), and an appendix on matrices. It features
      improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition.
