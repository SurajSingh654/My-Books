        <h2>The Definitive Java Programming Guide</h2>
        <p>Fully updated for Java SE 11, Java: The Complete Reference, Eleventh Edition explains how to develop, compile, debug, and run Java programs. Best-selling programming author Herb Schildt covers the entire Java language, including its
          syntax,
          keywords, and fundamental programming principles. You’ll also find information on key portions of the Java API library, such as I/O, the Collections Framework, the stream library, and the concurrency utilities. Swing, JavaBeans, and
          servlets
          are examined and numerous examples demonstrate Java in action. Of course, the very important module system is discussed in detail.
          This Oracle Press resource also offers an introduction to JShell, Java’s interactive programming tool. Best of
          all, the book is written in the clear, crisp, uncompromising style that has made Schildt the choice of millions worldwide.

        <h2>Objective Arithematic</h2>
        <p>Fast Track Objective Arithmetic is a book for students who need to revisit their education in mathematics so as to gain an edge in various competitive exams by improving their arithmetic abilities. To assess an aspirant’s ability to apply
          simple arithmetic formulas as well ones understanding of mathematical logic, most competitive examinations do include a set of arithmetical problems in the question papers laid out. This book has been put together keeping in mind aspirants
          of
          competitive examinations who intend to compete at an all India level.
          The objective questions are also very helpful for students to compete at the entrance examinations conducted by many private and public institutions offering prestigious courses in management, commerce, accountancy and others. Apart from
          solved questions and illustrations, the book also contains practice papers and model tests to enable the student to understand the upcoming paper pattern, solve the questions by oneself and to make a self-analysis about ones preparedness.

        <h2>Introduction To Algorithms</h2>
        <p>The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in
          English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor. The third edition has been revised and
          updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called “Divide-and-Conquer”), and an appendix on matrices. It features
          improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition.
